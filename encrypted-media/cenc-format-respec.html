      <p>This specification defines the stream format and initialization data for using ISO Base media File Format (ISOBMFF) content using the ISO Common Encryption ('cenc') protection scheme with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/"Encrypted Media Extensions</a>.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>The working groups maintains <a href="http://w3.org/brief/MjY5">a list of all bug reports that the editors have not yet tried to address</a>.</p>
      <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage should join the mailing list mentioned below and take part in the discussions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stream-format">
      <h2>Stream Format</h2>
      <p>Under the 'cenc' protection scheme, ISOBMFF content is encrypted at the sample level with AES-128 CTR encryption, according to ISO/IEC 23001-7:2012, "Information technology - MPEG system technologies - Part 7: Common encryption in ISO base media file format files". This protection method enables multiple Key Systems to decrypt the same media content.</p>
      <p>Each key is identified by a Key ID and each encrypted sample is associated with the Key ID of the key needed to decrypt it. This association is signaled either through the specification of a default Key ID in the track encryption box ('tenc') or by assigning the sample to a Sample Group, the definition of which specifies a Key ID. Common encryption files may contain a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted samples.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="detect-encrypt">
      <h2>Detecting Encryption</h2>
      <p>Protection scheme signaling conforms with ISO/IEC 14496-12:2012. When protection has been applied, the stream type will be transformed to 'encv' for video or 'enca' for audio, with a Protection Scheme Information Box ('sinf') added to the sample entry in the Sample Description Box ('stsd'). The Protection Scheme Information Box ('sinf') will contain a Scheme Type Box ('schm') with a scheme_type field set to a value of 'cenc' (Common Encryption).</p>
      <p>The "encrypted block" is a sample. Determining whether a sample is encrypted depends on the corresponding Track Encryption Box ('tenc') and the sample group with grouping type 'seig' (CencSampleEncryption group), if any, associated with the sample.
      The default encryption state of a sample is defined by the IsEncrypted flag in the associated track encryption box ('tenc'). This default state may be modified by the IsEncrypted flag in the SampleGroupDescriptionBox ('sgpd'), pointed to by an index in the SampleToGroupBox ('sbgp').</p>
      <p>Samples can be partially encrypted, specified by subsample information referenced by SampleAuxiliaryInformationSizesBox (‘saiz’) and SampleAuxiliaryInformationOffsetsBox ('saio') boxes.</p>
      <p>For complete information, see ISO/IEC 23001-7:2012.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="init-data">
      <h2>Initialization Data and Events</h2>
      <p>Common Encryption files may contain one or more protection system specific header ('pssh') boxes, each for a different SystemID.</p>
      <p>‘pssh’ boxes stored in movie fragment boxes are intended to store keys referenced by KID in a sample group description contained in that movie fragment, where the KID in the sample group description overrides the default_KID specified for the track in the track encryption box (‘tenc’).  Each ‘moof’/’pssh’ must protect the contained keys with a SystemID specific method.  Sample groups and ‘pssh’ key storage in movie fragments enable keys to be changed and accessed without interruption during playback of a track.</p>
      <p>ISO Common Encryption 2nd Edition also specifies storage of a ‘pssh’ box base64 encoded in an XML element of the form &lt;cenc:pssh (base64 ‘pssh’)&gt;.  For instance, DASH manifests may provide ‘pssh’ boxes in this format, each contained in a ContentProtection Descriptor element identified by a SystemID.  These ‘pssh’ boxes may be decoded and concatenated by an application to provide equivalent Initialization Data to that stored in movie or movie fragment boxes.</p>

      <p><a href="encrypted-media.html#initialization-data">Initialization Data</a> is always one or more concatenated 'pssh' boxes.  The application may parse out 'pssh' boxes which do not correspond to the selected key system, and may not use the InitData from the file at all and instead use initData from another source (e.g. the XML element described above). The CDM must be able to filter multiple 'pssh' in the initData to find the 'pssh' box which is Key System appropriate.</p>
      <p>Each time one or more 'pssh' boxes are encountered, the <a href="encrypted-media.html#algorithms-initdata-encountered">Initialization Data Encountered</a> algorithm shall be invoked with <var title="">initDataType</var> = "cenc" and <var title="">initData</var> = the 'pssh' boxes(s).  Multiple 'pssh' boxes must be provided together if and only if they appear directly next to each other in the file.</p>

      <p>If a supported 'pssh' box (based on SystemID) is not found while processing the <var>initData</var> in the <code><a href="encrypted-media.html#dom-createsession">createSession()</a></code> algorithm, follow the algorithm step for "<var>init data</var> is not supported by the <var>cdm</var>."</p>

    <section id="common-system">
      <h2>Common SystemID and PSSH Box Format</h2>
      <p>This section defines a common open SystemID and PSSH box format for use with EME.
        Key System implementations supporting ISO Common Encryption should support this SystemID and format, though they may prefer another SystemID when present in the Initialization Data.
        It is also recommended that media resources contain appropriate PSSH box(s) for this SystemID so that they may be used by any Key System implementation that supports it.</p>
      <p><a href="encrypted-media.html#clear-key">Clear Key</a> uses this SystemID for ISO Common Encryption content.
        When <code><a href="encrypted-media.html#dom-createsession">createSession()</a></code> is called with <var>initDataType</var> "cenc", the Clear Key CDM will use the PSSH box with this SystemID to generate a license request.
